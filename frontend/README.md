# StreamLine — Frontend

The StreamLine web app: a marketing landing page plus the dApp where clients create streams, freelancers watch money arrive in real time, and either side manages milestones — all gasless via zkLogin + Enoki-sponsored transactions.

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router) · React 19
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 · sharp-corner / monospace aesthetic · three.js **Bayer-dither** hero
- **Sui:** `@mysten/dapp-kit`, `@mysten/sui` (PTBs), `@mysten/enoki` (zkLogin + sponsorship)

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000 (Turbopack)
npm run build      # production build
npm run start      # serve the production build
npm run lint
```

The app ships pointing at the **live testnet deployment** — the StreamLine package ID and mintable test-USDC type are baked into `src/lib/constants.ts`, so no env setup is needed to click around. Sponsorship (full gasless) turns on when `ENOKI_PRIVATE_API_KEY` is set.

### App surface (receiver = freelancer · payer = client)

- **Dashboard** — numbered stream tabs (public + private 🔒) with a live earn
  counter; a **Completed** tab parks fully-settled streams and reveals the
  counterparty. Paused streams show the **mutual dispute-resolution** panel.
- **Create stream** — milestones, splits, and a **Private amounts** toggle
  (Groth16 + Seal). The yield-flagged split % becomes on-chain auto-yield via
  `create_stream_v2`.
- **Yield** — deposit into the Scallop-shaped vault and watch it compound live
  (auto-yield receipts from streams show here too).
- **Collateral** — borrow against a dripping stream's present value; repay with
  live-accruing interest.

## Gasless transactions

Two layers keep users gasless:

1. **zkLogin (Enoki)** — Google sign-in produces a Sui address; users never manage keys or buy SUI.
2. **Sponsorship** — PTBs are built with `onlyTransactionKind: true`, sent to `/api/sponsor` which calls the Enoki REST API server-side (the secret key never reaches the browser), signed by the user, then submitted via `/api/sponsor/execute`. Only allowlisted Move-call targets (`enoki-targets.ts`) can be sponsored.

On testnet, the **faucet** (`FaucetButton`) mints test USDC from the shared `TreasuryCap` so you can fund a stream end-to-end.

## Environment

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_NETWORK` | `testnet` | Active Sui network. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PACKAGE_ID_TESTNET` | baked-in testnet package | Override the StreamLine package. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC_TYPE_TESTNET` | test USDC type | Override the streamed coin type. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_INDEXER_URL` / `_WS_URL` | local indexer | REST + WebSocket endpoints. |
| `ENOKI_PRIVATE_API_KEY` | _unset_ | **Server-only** sponsor key; enables gasless when present. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENOKI_API_KEY` | _unset_ | Public Enoki key for zkLogin wallet registration. |

> `ENOKI_PRIVATE_API_KEY` must never be exposed to the client — it's read only inside `app/api/sponsor/*` route handlers.

## The Bayer-dither hero

`components/hero/` renders a looping video (or still image) through a real WebGL **ordered-dithering** shader, recolored to StreamLine's palette. Cursor movement injects ripples into a water simulation that feeds the dither — "money flowing." It falls back to a static image if the video can't load. See `bayerDitherShared.ts` for the shader + Bayer matrix.
